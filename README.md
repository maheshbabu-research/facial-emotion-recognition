Facial Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning - (Custom CNN), RESNET

**Project Objective**:
The main purpose of this project is to develop an advanced system for Facial Emotion Detection using computer vision techniques. The goal is to build accurate and efficient models for detecting facial emotions from images, with a focus on achieving high performance using various architectures. The project aims to explore the effectiveness of VGG, RESNET, and Custom CNN models in accurately classifying facial emotions, which has applications in interactive systems and emotional analysis.

Project Description:
This project involves Facial Emotion Detection using three different models: VGG, RESNET, and a Custom CNN. The Cohn-Kanade (CK+) dataset, which contains 902 samples of 48x48 grayscale images, is utilized for training and evaluation. The project aims to determine which model—VGG, RESNET, or Custom CNN—provides the highest accuracy and performance for emotion detection.

Challenges include optimizing each model for effective emotion classification and handling variations in facial expressions across the dataset. The project explores how different architectures perform in detecting and classifying emotions from facial images.
